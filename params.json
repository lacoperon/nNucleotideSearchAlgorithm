{"name":"nNucleotide Foreign Gene Search Tool","tagline":"Program to calculate the nNucleotide Frequencies of a Genome, to identify foreign regions in the genome","body":"### What is the program?\r\nThis program is a search tool, which allows you to analyze a single genome (without any reference to another) and find regions in the genome that are most likely to have undergone a recent event (such as Horizontal Gene Transfer, Recombination or Viral Infection) in which non-native DNA sequences were inserted into the genome. These foreign segments are then run through NCBI's BLAST API, allowing you to see which organisms that the foreign segment potentially could have been taken up from.\r\n\r\n### How to Use\r\nThe program allows you to upload a DNA sequence (in .fasta or .txt format) for analysis, choose the segmentation length of the algorithm, as well as to choose the threshold parameters for the program's identification of potentially foreign sequences . Then, the program will run (it may take several minutes to an hour to run, depending on the genome length). (This length is due to the text-parsing time, as  the FASTA genome format, the standard, is saved in 8-bit ASCII format, instead of the 2-bit format that is minimally necessary for genomic data.)\r\n\r\n\r\n##The Algorithm Itself\r\nThe genome imported is sliced into many segments, of length segmentLength (specified in the GUI). Then, statistics based upon n-mer nucleotide string frequency within the genomic segments are parsed into n-mer 'scores' for each segment, and those segments are then BLASTed (with a rate limited by the NCBI's querying limitations).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant a feature?
